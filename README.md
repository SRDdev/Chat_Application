## Libraries & Frameworks
1. Socket
    - It helps us to connect a client to a server. Client is message sender and receiver and server is just a listener that works on data sent by client.

2. Thread 
    - A thread is a light-weight process that does not require much memory overhead, they are cheaper than processes.
